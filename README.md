# 🌎 Overview

**AKWEMED** is a prototype **clinical artificial intelligence assistant** designed to support medical decision-making in **intercultural healthcare contexts**, particularly within **Indigenous communities in Brazil**.

The system combines:

- Indigenous language interpretation
- Retrieval-Augmented Clinical Reasoning (RAG)
- Local AI inference
- Mobile-first deployment
- Offline operation capability

The goal is to reduce **communication barriers between healthcare professionals and Indigenous patients**.

---

# 🧭 Motivation

In many Indigenous territories, healthcare professionals face challenges such as:

- linguistic barriers  
- culturally specific symptom descriptions  
- lack of clinical decision support tools adapted to local contexts  
- limited internet connectivity  

AKWEMED explores how **AI systems can assist intercultural clinical communication**.

The system integrates linguistic interpretation of **Xerente (Akwẽ)** expressions with clinical protocol retrieval.

Example input:

```
ĩsĩ kâ peito
```

System interpretation:

```
dor no peito
```

Clinical output:

```
Possible protocol: Acute Coronary Syndrome
```

---

# 🧠 System Architecture

AKWEMED follows a **multi-layer architecture** separating the clinical interface from the AI reasoning engine.

```
React Frontend (Chat Interface)
        ↓
Django REST API
        ↓
FastAPI AI Service
        ↓
Xerente Language Interpreter
        ↓
Clinical RAG Engine
        ↓
Protocol Knowledge Base
```

---

# ⚙️ Core Components

## Frontend

**React + TailwindCSS**

Provides a conversational clinical interface:

- chatbot-style UI  
- clinical response cards  
- mobile-friendly layout  
- real-time API interaction  

---

## Backend API

**Django REST Framework**

Responsible for:

- request validation  
- API routing  
- integration with AI service  
- authentication layer (future)  

---

## AI Service

**FastAPI**

Handles:

- natural language interpretation  
- clinical retrieval  
- inference logic  
- semantic similarity search  

---

## Linguistic Layer

The **Xerente interpreter** normalizes indigenous expressions into medical concepts.

Example:

```
ĩsĩ → dor
kâ → em / no
```

Normalized query:

```
dor no peito
```

---

## Clinical Knowledge Retrieval

The system uses **sentence-transformer embeddings** to perform semantic search over clinical protocols.

Pipeline:

```
query → embedding → similarity search → protocol match
```
